# About
The target of this project is to create a climate Fintech application as Saas.
As this is hackathon driven, so this will be taken under the [rapyd hackathon](https://rapyd.hackerearth.com/).

## Idea:-
This product intends to provide a fully functioning Fintech solution with Rapyd API's.
Also by adding the climate tech to Fin tech (i.e. Climate Fintech) we intend to create a 
website through which a company can check its carbon footprints and also the possible products or methods to reduce it.
Apart from it, the transactions done by this website will give you some leaf points.

## Leaf:-
Leafs are the points that you will earn by transcations (let's 1 leaf per 100$ transaction).
All these leaves together form a tree.
By Earning a tree you can earn some eco-friendly products as a contribution to the reduction of global warming.

## Fin tech:-
Fin tech part will have a wallet through which users can carry out the transactions as easy as UPI transactions.
Also, to add money to the wallet or to purchase some thing without using the wallet, then rapyd API's will carry out the process.
Payment will get auto deducted (if the option is turned on by the user) for monthly subscriptions so that user can get their services without interruption.
A minimum balance should present in auto deduction.
Also, apart from this a negative balance will also be there upto 0-5$ so that smaller amounts in transactions may not get affected.
The negative balance scale will depend on how much active the user is(both payment and presence wise).

## Climate tech:-
  Not prepared yet.
